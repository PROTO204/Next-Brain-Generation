# Next-Brain-Generation
Description &amp; Code needed for the PROTOBOX Sprint 

**DESCRIPTION**

The PROTO204 (innovation Lab in Paris-Saclay campus) has organised acceleration programs & hackathons ("Urban Moves" for Nokia 2017, "Next Brain Generation" for IoT World Congress - 2018) to develop new services on connected objects. After this two years experience, we have decided to design a fully operationnal sandbox to prototype seamlessly an idea in the Internet Of Things (IoT) : the PROTOBOX. The PROTOBOX easily build for pedagogical uses or any low cost projects. All nformations to build and operate with the PROTOBOX is here. 

In 2019, we will organise two Sprint with 1/ 16 student of the Master 2 SETI (Université Paris-Saclay), 2/ 17 students of Master 1 HCI (Université Paris-Saclay).  

This repository gather all the pedagogical materials to :

1/ Get Inspiration and Find an idea

2/ Learn the basis of the developer environment (Python, Raspberry, Git, SSH...) 

3/ Identify powerfull librairy to get the most of the PROTOBOX
